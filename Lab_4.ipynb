If you play that sound you probably won’t hear most of the content since you won’t have a 7 speaker setup, import it in a multi-channel editor such as Audacity and you will get a sense of what’s in there. Since it sounds so boring you need to add some reverb and 3D-locate the sounds so that it sounds more exciting. Try to make it sound better using what we have done so far.
